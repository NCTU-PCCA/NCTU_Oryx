\paragraph{Josephus Problem}
Let $f(i)$ be the survivor in the round with $i$ people, in the numbering from $0\sim i-1$. Then we have $f(1) = 0$ and $f(i+1) = (f(i)+k) mod (i+1)$. The $+k$ term is to restore the numbering, but stepping through $k$ people. Note that $f(i)$ and $f(i+1)$ used distinct numbering, where $k$th in $f(i+1)$'s is the $0$th in $f(i)$'s.
\paragraph{Pick's Theorem}
For a polygon consist integral-coordinate vertices. Let the number of integral points on the border of the polygon be $a$, and the number of integral points inside the polygon be $b$, then we have the area of the polygon:
$$
A = a+\frac{b}{2}-1
$$
\paragraph{Burnside's Lemma}
$$
|X/G| = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}{|X_g|}
$$
\paragraph{Mobius Inversion}
For $n\in \mathbb{N}$, if
$$
g(n)=\sum_{d|n}{f(d)}
$$
then
$$
f(n)=\sum_{d|n}{\mu(d)g(n/d)}
$$
